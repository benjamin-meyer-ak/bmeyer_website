<p>Click the link above for yet another great story from KDLL public radio’s Sabine Poux about a neat project I’ve been involved with. Over half Alaska’s salmon streams have yet to be mapped, and it takes a lot of work to get them catalogued. The Kenai Peninsula Chapter of Trout Unlimited sponsored a project to help in this task using their own volunteer chapter members, and I had the privilege of helping along the way.</p>
