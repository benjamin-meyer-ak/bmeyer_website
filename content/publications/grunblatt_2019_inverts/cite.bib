behalf of the Academy of Forensic Science. Stream fish rely on a mix of
terrestrial and aquatic prey sources. While the importance of terrestrial
invertebrates as a food source for stream fish is well documented, the
role of aquatic insects that emerge from the stream as winged adult
insects (aquatic winged adults) and return to the stream as prey is less
understood. In this study we determined the proportion of total diet for
stream-rearing juvenile Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) that is derived
from terrestrial and aquatic winged adult invertebrates which enter the
stream from riparian habitats and consider how those cross-ecosystem prey
contributions vary based on riparian habitat type. Study reaches were
identified in three streams within the Kenai River watershed of Alaska
that were representative of habitats found throughout the region and
riparian vegetation was classified into grass/sedge, shrub and tree types
using {LiDAR}. Juvenile Coho Salmon stomach contents were sampled seasonally
in study reaches over a two-year period and ingested invertebrates were
identified by taxa, life stage and origin. Our results showed that aquatic
winged adult prey contributions to juvenile salmon diet were significantly
lower in the grass/sedge study reach, and cross-ecosystem invertebrate
prey represented a significantly higher proportion of juvenile salmon diet
in the tree study reach. Invertebrate prey in the grass/sedge reach were
composed primarily of the larval life stage of aquatic winged adults.
These results suggest that change in riparian vegetation from tree/shrub
to grass/sedge along Kenai streams as projected by regional climate change
models, or that results from anthropogenic modification, will likely lead
to lower availability of cross-ecosystem prey for stream fish. Management
of riparian buffers along streams to preserve or increase occurrence of
trees and shrubs is likely to help mitigate impacts of those possible
changes.},
