	abstract = {© 2017, American Fisheries Society. Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. face
serious challenges from climate and landscape change, particularly in the
southern portion of their native range. Conversely, climate warming
appears to be allowing salmon to expand northwards into the Arctic.
Between these geographic extremes, in the Gulf of Alaska region, salmon
are at historically high abundances but face an uncertain future due to
rapid environmental change. We examined changes in climate, hydrology,
land cover, salmon populations, and fisheries over the past 30–70 years in
this region. We focused on the Kenai River, which supports world-famous
fisheries but where Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha populations have
declined, raising concerns about their future resilience. The region is
warming and experiencing drier summers and wetter autumns. The landscape
is also changing, with melting glaciers, wetland loss, wildfires, and
human development. This environmental transformation will likely harm some
salmon populations while benefiting others. Lowland salmon streams are
especially vulnerable, but retreating glaciers may allow production gains
in other streams. Some fishing communities harvest a diverse portfolio of
fluctuating resources, whereas others have specialized over time,
potentially limiting their resilience. Maintaining diverse habitats and
salmon runs may allow ecosystems and fisheries to continue to thrive
amidst these changes.},
