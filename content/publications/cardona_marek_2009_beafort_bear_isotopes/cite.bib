Southern Beaufort Sea polar bears (Ursus maritimus) captured in the spring
of 2005. Stable isotopic signatures (i.e., 13C/12C, delta13C; 15N/14N,
delta15N) in hair and two blood compartments (packed blood cells/clot and
serum) were determined to assess the variation of Hg concentrations among
polar bears in relation to their feeding ecology and other biological
factors. Concentrations of Hg in hair and blood (2.2-23.9 microg/g dry wt
and 0.007-0.213 microg/g wet wt, respectively) were within the range of
values previously reported for polar bears in Canada and East Greenland.
Mercury concentration in hair from females was higher than that in hair
from males, and concentration was related to interactions between
delta13C, delta15N, and longitude of capture location. Mercury
concentrations in hair were inversely correlated to delta13C in hair and
blood, suggesting that polar bears with greater total Hg concentrations
fed more on pelagic prey, such as ringed seals or beluga whale, than on
benthic prey. Variability in Hg concentrations in polar bear hair and
blood may be the result of intraspecific or regional variation in prey
selection rather than strictly trophic level interactions.},
