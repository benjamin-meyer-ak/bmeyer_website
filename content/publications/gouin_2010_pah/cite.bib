	abstract = {There has been increasing interest regarding the use of passive air
samplers as tools for monitoring organic pollutants in the atmosphere. In
this study we report results obtained from passive air samplers that were
deployed in both indoor and outdoor environments across the City of
Fairbanks, {AK}, for the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ({PAHs}) during
winter 2009. It is demonstrated that the passive air samplers provide
reliable data for the gas-phase {PAHs}. Results for particulate-phase
isomers, however, are more variable and thus likely to be less reliable.
For instance, the use of passive air samplers in indoor environments does
not appear effective for distinguishing between homes with and without
wood stoves, largely due to discrepancies associated with measuring
particulate phase {PAHs}. Consequently, it is suggested that the passive air
samplers should not be used for assessing indoor exposures to
particulate-bound pollutants. Nevertheless, air concentrations obtained
from active air samplers indicate that {PAHs} in air are dominated by the
gas-phase isomers, resulting in good agreement between the active and
passive air samplers for outdoor air. The average passive indoor air
concentrations for ∑{PAH}20 are observed to be slightly higher than passive
outdoor air concentrations, at 55 and 26 ng m-3 respectively.
Concentrations in outdoor air for the City of Fairbanks are reported to be
an order of magnitude lower during 2009 than during the winter of 1976/77,
when they were last reported. Snow data for the {PAHs} are reported as a
complement to the air concentration data, showing similar isomer patterns
between air and undisturbed snowpack samples. Snow samples collected from
snow dump collection sites are reported to be 25 times greater than nearby
undisturbed snow, and are dominated by the particulate-phase {PAHs}.
Recommendations for future monitoring of snowmelt from the snow dump
collection sites are suggested. © Author(s) 2010.},
