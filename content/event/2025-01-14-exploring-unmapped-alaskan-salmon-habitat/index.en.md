Sometimes the best treasures are already right under our feet, just waiting for us to notice them. 
Such is the story with the thousands of rivers, streams, and lakes that are home to Alaskaâ€™s wild salmon.

In September 2024 I had the privilege of highlighting local efforts to map anadromous waters in the central 
Kenai Peninsula at the national meeting of the American Fisheries Society in Honolulu. Click the image below 
or visit [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u62Md_aYzPk) to see my talk.

Visit Kenai Watershed Forum's [website](https://www.kenaiwatershed.org/news-media/new-documented-local-salmon-habitat/) to learn more more about the past, present, and future of mapping anadromous waters
in Alaska.
