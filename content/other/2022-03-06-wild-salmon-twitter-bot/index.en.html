<p>In spring 2017 I found myself distracted one afternoon by all the news about bots on social media and their supposed ability to sway political outcomes. There appeared to not yet be such a bot promoting all that wild salmon give to our world, so I made one. As of March 2022 the Twitter account <code>@wildsalmonbot</code> has tweeted 3,642 silly, non-sensical, and/or profound mad-libs style statements about wild salmon.</p>
<p>The most popular tweet so far was on December 21, 2021:</p>
<p><em>“Wild salmon are splish-splashin’ party animals that will outlast us. #wildsalmon.”</em></p>
<p>I’m not how or why that tweet caught such traction, but it was flattering to know that my creation had an audience.</p>
