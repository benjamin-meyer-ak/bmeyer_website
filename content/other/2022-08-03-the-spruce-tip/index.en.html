<p>I make no confession as to whether or not I may or may not be involved with contributing satirical rants to <a href="https://www.thesprucetip.com">www.thesprucetip.com</a>; along with another local character whose work may be found at <a href="https://johnlmessick.com/" class="uri">https://johnlmessick.com/</a>.</p>
<p>I will say, however, that we are both fans of Swift and Twain, and think we could all use a better sense of humor in our lives!</p>
