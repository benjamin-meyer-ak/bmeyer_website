<p>Each fall the Alaska State Fair hosts an annual Giant Cabbage Weigh-Off, where gardeners from around the state compete to see whose cabbage outweighs the competition. Either myself or someone in my family has entered a cabbage for most of the last two decades. We’ve never quite approached Scott Robb’s 138 lb record monstrosity, but we’ve always done respectably.</p>
<p>In earlier years, the contest had corporate sponsorship from Kraft Foods, which also sponsored a few side-contests including a Cabbage Limerick Contest. When that sponsor dropped the limerick contest did too. Some years later my family decided to take up the reins of organizing the limerick contest, and the Meyer family has sponsored it since 2019.</p>
<p>I’m in the process of assembling a highlights from this contest in to a booklet or website, for now you can check out the 2021 contest winners here:</p>
